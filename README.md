# BMI-DC
This prototypical implementation is dedicated to synthesizing invariant barrier certificates via difference-of-convex programming. It takes as input a differential dynamical system together with an initial and an unsafe set, and tries to find an invariant barrier certificate B(x) (in the form of a given template) that suffices to prove unbounded-time safety of the system.
